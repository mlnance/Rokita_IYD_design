I.E. KEEP A DIR OF COPIES OF THE INPUT PDBs

score_vs_rmsd_full.py was taken from Rosetta/tools/protein_tools and edited to work locally
doesn't seem to work with gzipped PDBs

requires a preparation phase for bact_IYD because it doesn't like the ligands
it complains about FMN and flavin_mononucleotide not being the same name
same for 2IP and 2-iodophenol (not really sure where it has an issue)
the preparation script handles this by replacing the long name with the short
and OVERWRITING the input PDB
hence, a COPY of ALL PDBs to be analyzed should be kept
