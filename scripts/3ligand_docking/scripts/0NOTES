'mld' means 'multiple ligand docking' where both 2IP and FMN are docked

to run the generate scripts, but all of the relevant pdb name extensions in a file
(here called 0pdb_names) and do

## single ligand docking
while read line
do
    /path/to/scripts/./gen_lig_dock_flags.sh $line > 1$line"_flags"
    /path/to/scripts/./gen_lig_dock_xml.sh $line > 1$line"_dock.xml"
done < 0pdb_names
where $line would be something like 'bact_IYD_02961'

## multiple ligand docking
while read line
do
    /path/to/scripts/./gen_lig_dock_mld_flags.sh $line > 1$line"_mld_flags"
    /path/to/scripts/./gen_lig_dock_mld_xml.sh $line > 1$line"_mld_dock.xml"
done < 0pdb_names
where $line would be something like 'bact_IYD_02961'
