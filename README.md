Tools and PDB files for attempts at finding a productive mutation of IYD to enhance its affinity for 2ID

bact IYD chain A and B was created by aligning the bact_IYD_chainA.pdb onto chain A and then chain B of the PDB 4ttb. Concatinating the new coordinates of the two bact_IYD_chainA copies into one file gives this bact_IYD_chainAB.pdb file
